# Practice assignment 7
Download the titanic dataset from kaggle. Unzip the folder and keep only the train.csv
file. Rename the file as titanic. csv
Create a GitHub repository called “st2195_assignment_7” and include an R script able
to perform the operations described below.
1. Generate a series of bar charts to describe the gender, ticket class and survival
of the passengers onboard. [1 point]
2. Generate a histogram for the passengers’ age. Furthermore, describe the
passengers’ age using the following two boxplots: age per ticket class and age
based on survival. [1 point]
3. Generate a histogram for the travel fare and a table showing the number of
people who did not pay – you may want to check on Google why a handful of
people was on board for free! [1 points]
4. A chart of your choice to describe the family size per ticket class [1.5 points]
5. A series of stacked bar charts to show the how survival differs for different
gender and ticket class [1.5 points]
6. A violin chart describing how survival related to age and gender [1.5 points]
7. A violin chart describing the survival rate related to age and ticket class [1.5
points]


# Practice assignment 8
Create a GitHub repository called “st2195_assignment_8” and include the following
Python scripts:
1. assignment_8_1.ipynb to replicate assignment 7 in Python [5 points]
2. assignment_8_2.ipynb to describe the latest bilateral trade data for the G7 (this
aggregate can be computed using bilateral imports and exports data available on
the IMF Direction of Trade Statistics) with the three network graphical
representations in the module on network visualisation [2.5 points]
3. assignment_8_3.ipynb to repeat the second bullet point using one year ago data
and compare the output with the latest results using a 3x2 subplot containing all
the network representations [2.5 points]
